    This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed Professor Angell. He questioned the
sculptor with scientific interest; and studied the bas-relief on which the young man had been working, chilled and clad
only in his night clothes. My uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterwards said, because he could not recognize both
hieroglyphics and pictorial design fast enough. Many of his questions seemed highly inappropriate to his visitor,
especially those which tried to connect the things with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand the
promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or
paganly religious society. When Professor Angell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or
system of cryptic lore, he asked his visitor to supply him with future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit,
because after the first interview the manuscript records daily visits of the young man, during which he related
startling fragments of nocturnal imagery. He was always talking about some terrible Cyclopean views of dark and dripping
stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously enigmatical uninscribable gibberish. The two sounds
frequently repeated are rendered by the letters “Cthulhu” and “R’lyeh.”
